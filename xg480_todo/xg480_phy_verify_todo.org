<2018-11-19 Mon 17:30> in eth-fpga3, do make update, re-run tc_407 tc_407a tc_405 tc_405a, the result will get on tomorrow.

10 times test, all pass. the packet size should >= 512

*** DONE tc_213 xg480_phy_25g/10g device pause response test. the RTL has been ready

0 2 4 6 enable pause, 1 3 5 7 port disable pause. the quanta = 00 or FF
Pause response is added in mac_tx module, the related changes in core level RTL is also done. Please Dongping run test cases to verify the pause response function.

Please note that:
   The pause backpressure doesn't affect down injected Y1564  - from the stack, the Y1564 DOWN injection is after MAC_TX.
   The pause backpressure doesn't affect pause/dying gasp injection

mulit seg packet 

tc_213, pause peer function basic testcase, when receiving pause with quanta 0xffff, the traffic will stop; reveiving the pasue with quanta 0x0 the traffic will go on.

*** DONE tc_302b testcase result. RTL has bug, need Bob double check. has been sent email.

    <2018-11-21 Wed 14:37>the vlan det lookup method has bug, the number of matchIds is not same as DUT, after Lance modified it, the error has been gone.
